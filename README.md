This is a portfolio of some code samples. Please check out my website at www.david-gabriel.com

Within this repository there is:
- An agentic AI system I developed at Cloudera
- A AI paper I wrote in 2020 about using genetic algorithms to optimize for neural network hyperparameters. I acheived super linear speedup on NVIDIA tesla P100's in this paper
- A national stage patent I filed for a plasma physics device while working on an NIH grant (patent has since expired)
- some pthreads c code that calculates sum of squares. this is from a graduate level class I taught at Univeristy of Nevada Reno
- The solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem achieved by searching throught the state space https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem
